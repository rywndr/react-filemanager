# react-filemanager
a local file manager. In this file manager, we want to display the various types of media on our web application. This is similar to platforms like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Appleâ€™s iCloud.

# Description of the Features:

## a. Search Feature:
The search feature allows users to search for specific files within the Multimedia Web App. It provides a search bar where users can enter keywords or file names. Upon entering the search query, the app filters the file list and displays only the files that match the search criteria. This feature enables users to quickly locate and access their desired files.

## b. Sort by File Type and Size Feature:
The sort feature enables users to sort the file list based on file type and size. Users can select the desired sort option from a dropdown menu, such as "Sort by File Type" or "Sort by File Size." The app then rearranges the file list accordingly, displaying files in ascending or descending order based on the selected sorting criteria. This feature helps users organize and find files based on their specific requirements.

# Explanation of Feature Selection:

## The chosen features, search and sort by file type and size, are appropriate additions to the Multimedia Web App for the following reasons:
Search Feature: The search feature enhances the usability and efficiency of the app by providing a quick and convenient way to search for files. As the number of files in the app increases, it becomes challenging for users to manually locate specific files. The search feature solves this problem by allowing users to enter keywords or file names, significantly reducing the time and effort required to find files.

Sort by File Type and Size Feature: This feature provides users with additional flexibility in organizing and managing their files. Users may have specific requirements, such as grouping files of the same type together or identifying files based on their size. By incorporating the sort feature, the Multimedia Web App caters to these needs, enabling users to arrange and view files in a more meaningful and organized manner.

The new features mentioned, such as the search feature, sort by file type and size feature, and additional information in the file list (extension, file type, and file size), are not necessarily innovative or groundbreaking. They are commonly found in many file management systems and applications. However, they are valuable and useful features that enhance the functionality and user experience of the application. While they may not be considered highly innovative or stand out in terms of uniqueness, they contribute to the overall usability and effectiveness of the application.

# Explanation of Code Implementation:

## a. Search Feature Code:

The search feature is implemented using JavaScript to handle the user's search query and filter the file list. Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:

```
function searchFiles(query) {
  // Get the file list
  const fileList = getAllFiles();
```

In the above code snippet, the `searchFiles` function is defined to handle the search functionality. It takes a `query` parameter, which represents the user's search query. Inside the function, we retrieve the file list using the `getAllFiles` function (not shown in the code snippet), which could be a function responsible for fetching the file list from a data source.

```
// Filter files based on search query
  const filteredFiles = fileList.filter((file) => {
    // Perform case-insensitive search
    const fileName = file.name.toLowerCase();
    const searchQuery = query.toLowerCase();
    return fileName.includes(searchQuery);
  });
```

In this part of the code, the `filter` method is used on the `fileList` array to iterate over each file and determine if it should be included in the filtered files list. The arrow function `(file) => { ... }` is passed to the `filter` method and executed for each file. Inside the arrow function, the file name and search query are converted to lowercase using the `toLowerCase` method to perform a case-insensitive search. The `includes`   method is then used to check if the file name includes the search query. If it does, the file is included in the `filteredFiles` array.

```
  // Update the file list display with filtered files
  updateFileList(filteredFiles);
```
Finally, the `updateFileList` function (not shown in the code snippet) is called, passing the `filteredFiles` array as an argument. The `updateFileList` function would be responsible for updating the user interface to display the filtered files.

## b. Sort by File Type and Size Feature Code:

The sort feature is also implemented using JavaScript to handle the user's selection and rearrange the file list accordingly. Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:

```
function sortFilesByType() {
  // Get the file list
  const fileList = getAllFiles();
```

Similar to the search feature, the `sortFilesByType` function begins by retrieving the file list using the `getAllFiles` function.

```
  // Sort files by type (extension)
  const sortedFiles = fileList.sort((a, b) => {
    const fileTypeA = a.type.toLowerCase();
    const fileTypeB = b.type.toLowerCase();
    return fileTypeA.localeCompare(fileTypeB);
  });
```

In this part of the code, the `sort` method is used on the `fileList` array to rearrange the files based on file type (extension). The sort method takes a callback function `(a, b) => { ... }` that compares two files `(a and b)`. Inside the callback function, the file types of `a` and `b` are extracted and converted to lowercase using the `toLowerCase` method. Then, the `localeCompare` method is used to perform a case-insensitive string comparison between the file types. The callback function returns the result of the comparison, which determines the sorting order of the files.

```
// Update the file list display with sorted files
  updateFileList(sortedFiles);
```

Finally, the `updateFileList` function is called, passing the `sortedFiles` array as an argument. The `updateFileList` function would be responsible for updating the user interface to display the sorted files.

By implementing these search and sort features, the Multimedia Web App becomes more user-friendly and efficient. Users can easily search for specific files and they can sort the files by file type or size to quickly find what they're looking for. These features enhance the overall user experience and provide better organization and accessibility of multimedia files within the app.
